            <p>The concept of "cultural landscapes" can be found in the European tradition. Beginning in the 16th
                century, many European painters painted landscapes in favor of people, reducing the people in their
                pictures to figures within larger, regionally specific landscapes The word landscape itself combines the word "land" with the Germanic verb "scapjan/schaffen", which literally means "shaped land". Lands were then believed to have been formed by natural forces, and the specific details of such landshaffen (shaped lands) became the subject of "landscape" paintings themselves.<br><br>

            <p>Geographer Otto Schlueter first formally used "cultural landscape" as an academic term in the early 20th century. In 1908, Schl√ºter argued that defining geography as Landschaftskunde (the science of landscape) gives geography a logical subject that no other science has. He identified two forms of landscape:  Urlandschaft (trans. original landscape), or landscape that existed before major human-induced changes, and Kulturlandschaft (trans. "cultural landscape"), a landscape created by human culture. The main task of geography was to observe the changes in these two landscapes.<br><br> 
            Perhaps the most influential person in promoting and developing the idea of cultural landscapes was the  human geographer Carl O. Sauer. Sauer decided to emphasize the agency of culture in shaping the visible features of the Earth's surface in confined areas. According to his definition, the physical environment is of central importance as the medium through which human cultures move with and through. </p>
